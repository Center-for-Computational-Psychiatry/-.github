Welcome to the Mt. Sinai Center for Computational Psychiatry GitHub!

Here you can see papers our labs have published, and open source code produced from our projects. 
The center focuses on computational modeling for a wide range of psychiatric disorders including: depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, eating disorders, addiction and substance abuse, parkinsonâ€™s disorder, and borderline personality disorder. We use a combination of experimental techniques including fMRI, EEG, fNIRS, and computer-based behavioral tasks. 

Here are some of our repos:
