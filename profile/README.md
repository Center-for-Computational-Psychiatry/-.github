# Welcome!

The **Mt. Sinai Center for Computational Psychiatry (CCP)** is an interdisciplinary research group studying how quantitative tools and methodologies can be used to improve mental health diagnosis and treatment.

The CCP's mission is to leverage the rich clinical resources and computational expertise across departments at Mt. Sinai to deepen our understanding of how computational cognitive neuroscience can contribute to what we know about mental health issues. The Center is especially interested in a trans-diagnostic approach towards mental health, using computational modeling to examine how cognitive processes might change across a range of distinct diagnostic categories including: major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), eating disorders, addiction and substance abuse, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD).
